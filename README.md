# 100-days-of-oss-template
A journal template to help you keep up with your #100DaysOfOSS work. 

## Instructions
We recommend that you use this template to keep track of your work during the challenge. You can use it as a starting point and customize it to your needs. 

You might want to create a new repository for your journal, or you can fork this repository and use it as a starting point.

### Set a Goal
Before you start, you might want to set a goal for yourself. What do you want to accomplish in the next 100 days? What do you want to learn? What do you want to build or be a part of? Declaring that in your README will help you stay focused and motivated and will help others understand what you're working on.

#### Getting Started
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine
3. Create a new branch for each day of the challenge if you want to keep your work separate
4. Commit your work to your branch
5. Push your changes to your forked repository
6. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch of your forked repository
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for each day of the challenge

#### Tips for making the most out of #100DaysOfOSS
- Use the table-of-contents.md file to keep track of your work
- Commit your work every day, even if you don't have time to work on it for long
- If you don't have time to work on a project, read an article, watch a video, attend an event about an OSS topic that interests you
- If you get stuck, ask for help! You can ask a friend, a mentor, or the community for help. 
- If you get bored, try something new! There are so many ways to contribute to OSS. You can write code, write documentation, test software, translate content, and more.
- If you get frustrated, take a break. OSS is supposed to be fun! If you're not having fun, take a break and come back to it later.
